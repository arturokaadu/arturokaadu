## :bookmark_tabs: More About Me:
I started my academical journey studying english translation where I gained a lot of knowledge such as a proper way of communicating writing, speaking and pronunciation wise.
 Afterwards I moved on to media and entertainment management where I polished my soft skills in leadership and project management. 

While working in the textile industry for two years I learned how to work under pressure. in the meantime I managed to begin my career in the tech industry with a software development course where I was introduced to the basics of html, css, php and laravel. During the course I worked with a handful projects with php and laravel. I also began to understand and fall in love with the logical process of software development.

Upon finishing the course I realized I was still lacking logical training. That's when Henry stepped into my Career helping me to develop myself as a structured and succesfull professional. While attending the bootcamp I worked and became proficient with the following technologies: html | css | javascript | nodeJs, React js | redux | redux toolkit | Express | sequelize | github | postgresql | heidisql | mysql. 

In Henry I acquired a more disciplined course of action. I built several projects such as a weather app, a pokemon application and, as a final group proyect, a make up e commerce which also contained an admin page. 
I consider myself a passionate learner who is always eager to give his all in every project. I also recon myself as an active listener who is capable of properly communicating with any member of the team.
